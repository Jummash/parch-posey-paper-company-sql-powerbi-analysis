## 🧠 Methodology & Analytical Approach  

To ensure a structured and comprehensive analysis, I applied the following steps:  

- **Data Restructuring:** Unpivoted product quantity columns to enable comparison across paper types.  
- **Sales Aggregation:** Summarized revenues and order volumes across regions and timeframes.  
- **Customer Lifecycle Analysis:** Tracked the journey from first website visit to first purchase.

This approach ensured the insights were not just descriptive, but **strategically aligned with business decisions** in sales, marketing, and operations.
