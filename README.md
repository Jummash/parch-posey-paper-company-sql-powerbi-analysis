Business insights from Parch &amp; Posey data using SQL queries and Power BI

This project was developed during my time at **HerTechTrail Data Analytics Starter Track**.  
It combines **SQL for querying business data** and **Power BI for visualization** to uncover insights on sales, customer behavior, regional trends, and profitability.

## 🔎 About This Project  
This project presents **data-driven insights into operations at Parch & Posey**, a paper company seeking to optimize sales, customer engagement, and marketing efficiency.  

As a **Junior Analyst (project role)**, I used **SQL queries** to extract and analyze sales, marketing, and customer behavior data. The analysis explored **key patterns across regions, sales reps, product types, and timeframes**, leading to actionable business recommendations.

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Explore **sales trends** over time and across regions.  
- Identify **top-performing customers, sales reps, and products**.  
- Evaluate **revenue drivers** and marketing effectiveness.  
- Use **Power BI dashboards** to visualize KPIs for decision-making.

## 🧠 Methodology & Analytical Approach  

To ensure a structured and comprehensive analysis, I applied the following steps:  

- **Data Restructuring:** Unpivoted product quantity columns to enable comparison across paper types.  
- **Sales Aggregation:** Summarized revenues and order volumes across regions and timeframes.  
- **Customer Lifecycle Analysis:** Tracked the journey from first website visit to first purchase.  
- **Retention Segmentation:** Categorized purchase frequency to better understand customer retention and loyalty.

This approach ensured the insights were not just descriptive, but **strategically aligned with business decisions** in sales, marketing, and operations.
